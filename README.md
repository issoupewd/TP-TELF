# introduction 

I like sharing knowledge, but what I dislike is when that knowledge is copied without understanding it. That's why I won't provide all the work but rather share some of it to encourage active engagement.
It is important to focus on completing your lab work and learn tools such as simulation (e.g., Proteus), working with signal generators (GBF), and using an oscilloscope. These skills will be valuable in other labs and during the first semester of your third year and they are a must for an electrical engineering student.
