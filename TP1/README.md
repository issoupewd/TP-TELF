This Proteus file contains all the components needed. Simply connect the components and take the necessary measurements. The circuit details are available in the TP file or check the PNG image.

# NOTE
There's no Proteus preparation as it was the first lab. However, I created this circuit to complete the measurements at home. You can use it for preparation or assistance at home to complete the lab work.
