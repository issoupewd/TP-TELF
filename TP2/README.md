## TELF_TP2
Official documents provided by the department.

## TELF_TP2_comp
This Proteus file contains all the components needed. Just wire it up and take the necessary measurements. You can use either the frequency generator or the signal named GBF. The circuit is available in the TP file or check the prepa file.

## TP2_prepa
A pdf file that includes the preparation in Proteus and the theoretical part with all measurements and calculations removed, expet for the first three or the last for guidance. For theoretical calculations, I recommend using Excel or writing your own code as using a calculator may be time-consuming.

## TP2_calc_tab
An Excel file for performing calculations for the theoretical part's table.

## TP2_graph_script
To generate the required graphs in the lab, I used this MATLAB script. You can use any programming language you are familiar with.

## TP2_calcppr
You can print this document and use it during the lab, it will provide additional assistance.
